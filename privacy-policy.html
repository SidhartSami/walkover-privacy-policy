<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
WalkOver is a walking activity tracking application developed by HighBrow Developers.
This Privacy Policy explains how user data is collected, used, and stored.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>Location Data</h3>
<p>
WalkOver collects precise location data (GPS coordinates) only when the user explicitly
starts a walking activity by using the “Start Walk” feature.
Location tracking stops when the user ends the walk.
</p>

<p>
If a walk is not completed or the application closes unexpectedly, the walk data is not saved.
</p>

<p>
While location permission is granted, the app may display the user’s current location on the map,
but this location is not stored unless an active walk is in progress.
</p>

<h3>Walk Data</h3>
<p>
When a walk is completed, the following data is saved:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Route path (latitude and longitude points)</li>
  <li>Date and time of the walk</li>
  <li>Total distance traveled</li>
</ul>

<h3>Authentication Data</h3>
<p>
Firebase Authentication is used only to allow users to sign in and access their own walking data.
No authentication data is used for advertising or tracking purposes.
</p>

<h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
<p>
Collected data is used solely to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Display walking routes and history to the user</li>
  <li>Calculate distance and activity statistics</li>
  <li>Allow users to access their saved walks after signing in</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>
Walk data and account information are securely stored using Firebase services.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
WalkOver does not sell, share, or rent user data to third parties.
Data is not used for advertising or analytics.
</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
Users can delete individual walks within the app.
When a walk is deleted, all associated data is permanently removed from our servers.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
WalkOver is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect
personal data from children.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time.
Any changes will be reflected on this page.
</p>

<p>
Effective date: January 14, 2026
